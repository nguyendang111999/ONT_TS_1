Villager: Please help me. My village was being attacked by giant wolves

    * What are they look like?
    - Villager: Their size is like an ox. And they are really scary! I think there some weird dark smoke on them too!
    * Say no more brother! [] <>
- Show me the way.
- Villager: Follow this trail deep into the wood, you'll find it!
    *Ok <>
    Now find yourself a safe place. I am heading to the village now.
